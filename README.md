# :balance_scale: BMI Calculator

The website provides a set of basic functional calculators, including:
<br /><br />
* :standing_man: **BMI calculator** - Body Mass Index
* :lotus_position_woman: **BMR calculator** - Basal Metabolic Rate
* :weight_lifting_man: **PAL calculator** - Physical Activity Level
* :running_woman: **TMR calculator** - Total Metabolic Rate
<br />
The project allows users to save their data (like current BMI value) for future reference, which can particularly useful especially during weight loss or weight gain journeys.

## Overview
Honestly despite my interests in healthy lifestyle, I have never seen a website that offers all these useful and essential calculators.

All these calculators are so helpful in losing / gaining / maintaining weight so I decided to bring them all together and create a comprehensive website with each useful tool. 

The website is designed to be clear user-friendly. I've also put some effort to providing additional verified and effective information.

## Requirements

**Python 3.0** or any higher version


## Installation
<strong>1. Clone the repo at first:</strong>
<br />

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/olczi095/bmi-calculator.git
```
<br />
<strong>2. If you want to create the virtual environment particularly for that project and connect with it:</strong>

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
```
```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
  source venv/bin/activate # on MacOS/Unix
```
<br />
<strong>3. Change to the directory:</strong>

```bash
  cd mysite
```
<br />
<strong>4. Install the required dependencies:</strong>

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
<br />
<strong>5. Run the development server:</strong>

```bash
  python3 manage.py runserver
```
<br />
<strong>The website will be available in browsers at:</strong>

```bash
  http://localhost:8000/
```

## Features

- Fast calculating of BMI, BMR and TMR values without the need to log in or register
- Checking the table with detailed PAL values 
- Discover very useful info about losing weight/gaining weight etc.
- Creating an account (register) and log in / log out
- For registered and logged in users additional great options:

    * saving the submitted data (e.g. weight or height) in account for possibility to using them next time
    * saving the calculated values (e.g. BMI value) to check them next time and for example to compare last and current weight and notice the progress
