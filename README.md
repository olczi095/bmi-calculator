# :balance_scale: BMI Calculator

The website provides a set of basic functional calculators, including:
<br /><br />
* :standing_man: **BMI calculator** - Body Mass Index
* :lotus_position_woman: **BMR calculator** - Basal Metabolic Rate
* :weight_lifting_man: **PAL calculator** - Physical Activity Level
* :running_woman: **TMR calculator** - Total Metabolic Rate
<br />
The project allows users to save their data, including for example current BMI value and user biometric data such as weight, height, etc., for future reference, which can particularly useful especially during weight loss or weight gain journeys.
Additionally, the project offers three types of APIs: one for data manipulation (for 'Person' and 'CalculatedData' models in the database) and two for calculating BMI, BMR, and TMR values.

## Overview
Honestly despite my interests in healthy lifestyle, I have never seen a website that offers all these useful and essential calculators.

All these calculators are so helpful in losing / gaining / maintaining weight so I decided to bring them all together and create a comprehensive website with each useful tool. 

The website is designed to be clear user-friendly. I've also put some effort to providing additional verified and effective information.

## Requirements

**Python 3.0** or any higher version


## Installation
<strong>1. Clone the repo at first:</strong>
<br />

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/olczi095/bmi-calculator.git
```
<br />
<strong>2. If you want to create the virtual environment particularly for that project and connect with it:</strong>

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
```
```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
  source venv/bin/activate # on MacOS/Unix
```
<br />
<strong>3. Change to the project directory:</strong>

```bash
  cd mysite
```
<br />
<strong>4. Install the required dependencies:</strong>

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
<br />
<strong>5. Create a ".env" file and place the following code in it. Generate your own unique secret key and replace the key provided in the below code. Also, change the value of DEBUG to "True" or "False":</strong>

```bash
  SECRET_KEY=your_own_secret_key_here
  DEBUG=true_or_false
```
<br />
<strong>6. Run the development server:</strong>

```bash
  python3 manage.py runserver
```
<br />
<strong>The website will be available in browsers at:</strong>

```bash
  http://localhost:8000/
```

## Features

- Fast calculating of BMI, BMR and TMR values without the need to log in or register
- Checking the table with detailed PAL values 
- Discover very useful info about losing weight/gaining weight etc.
- Creating an account (register) and log in / log out
- For registered and logged in users additional great options:

    * saving the submitted data (e.g. weight or height) in account for possibility to using them next time
    * saving the calculated values (e.g. BMI value) to check them next time and for example to compare last and current weight and notice the progress

## API

### Person Model API

The API for the 'Person' model which utilizes ViewSets and token-based authorization. It allows admin to perform CRUD operations, while allowing owners to read and update their own 'Person' instances.

### CalculatedData API

The CalculatedDataAPI utilizes token-based authorization. It includes two classes: 'CalculatedDataListView' for listing data with admin permissions, and 'CalculatedDataDetailView' for retrieving and deleting individual instances with owner or admin permissions.

### Functional API

A more functional API built on class-based views used for calculating BMI, BMR and TMR values, based on provided information, available for everyone.
